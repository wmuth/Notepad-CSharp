# Notepad-CSharp
Basic notepad built in C# using Windows Forms
It does all the basic things you would expect a notepad to do. It allows you to write simple text, using all different characters, resizing the window doesn't break the text in any way. There are functions to open text files from your storage, save the current text to your storage and of course if you opened a text file and started editing it, clicking save will automatically save to the file you opended. The notepad will also ask you if you are sure you want to exit if you have unsaved edits.
